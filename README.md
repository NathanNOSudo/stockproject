## Getting Started

Feel free to fork it and tweak it to your likings. This is a basic quick build with many paths that are open to your exploration. Otherwise to try it out clone the repo to your local machine or download the zip. basiclly just open index.html in your browser and thats it!             

## Prerequisites

You need preferably the latest version of Chrome, a text editor and an imagination.

 ####  Go here for Chrome: https://www.google.com/chrome/
 #### VSCode is my go to: https://code.visualstudio.com/
 ####  An Imagination is a must. This is only the begining of what you can do with a little research!

## Installing

To get started follow this guide:
ON LINUX/UNIX


In your terminal clone repo to your local machine using git clone:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/NathanNOSudo/space-gladiatorsV3   
```
*If you want to customize it first then just open space-gladiatorsV3 in your editor*

I suggest LiveServer extension on VSCode to open game while customizing the 
files so you can monitor the changes. Once you have LiveServer on VSCode just
right click on the index.html and select preview in browser!
Thats it! Any changes you make its not a bad idea to make sure to 
save your files and reload the browser.
